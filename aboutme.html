      <p Class="border1">I've worked in the software industry the past 10 years in a number of
          support and project management roles.  Recently, I felt the need to move
          into the technical side of things.  After exhaustively researching
          code bootcamps, I decided to enroll in <span class="bold">Epicodus</span>.
          A week into school, I'm already overwhelmed, but loving it!</p>
